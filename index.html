    	<h1>Hi, This is Jessie</h1>
			<p>I'm originally from Taiwan and not into all the tags or identity stuffs. </p>
			<p>What I value most and my work would probably give you better ideas about me (in case you are interested). </p>
			<ul>
				<li> I live as a student for life. I always pursue to learn more, practice more, appreciate more, empathize more and love more.</li>
				<li>I am developing my life/note system to energize up daily life, which will be iterating forever. Currently, I don't have an ultimate purpose or goal, but I practice and commit to my principles and values.</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>Reading is one of my favorite thing</h3>
		<p>I have a very diverse appetite. But most of the time I find myself indulging in philosophy, psychology, culture, arts, then sometimes technology, business, etc. <a href="test">Scroll down for a list</a> of what I read, am reading, and will read, inspired by <a href="/test" target=_top>Kevin Simler.</a></p>
      <p>Also in my substack newsletter, there's a section called Weekly Links where I would share 1 great song and 5 interesting links on a weekly basis. Inspired by Kevin Kelly, and I am pretty committed to this.</p>

			<h3>I write in order to do better thinking and creating.</h3>
			<p>I can't help but write, even if there's little readers or support. It's okay and I'll just keep trying. Also, I devote myself to other kinds of creative works: music, photography, films, etc.</p>

    <p>你好，我是 Jessie。我不太熱衷於標籤或身份之類的事。下面是對我比較重要的價值，這或許能幫助你更好的認識我（假設你有興趣的話）：</p>
    <ul><li> Student for life 是我貫徹的生活方式——更多更好的學習、實踐、欣賞、同理、愛。</li>
           <li>I am developing my life/note system to energize up daily life, which will be iterating forever. Currently, I don't have an ultimate purpose or goal, but I practice and commit to my principles and values.</li></ul>
