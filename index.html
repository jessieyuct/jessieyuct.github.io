# Hi, This is Jessie.

I'm originally from Taiwan and not into all the tags or identity stuffs. 
What I value most and my work would probably give you better ideas about me (in case you are interested). 
- I live as a student for life. I always pursue to learn more, practice more, appreciate more, empathize more and love more.
- I am developing my life/note system to energize up daily life, which will be iterating forever. Currently, I don't have an ultimate purpose or goal, but I practice and commit to my principles and values.

## Reading is one of my favorite thing to do.

- I have a very diverse appetite. But most of the time I find myself indulging in philosophy, psychology, culture, arts, then sometimes technology, business, etc. [Here's a list](/reading) of what I read, am reading, and will read, inspired by [Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/what-im-reading/).
- Also in my substack newsletter, there's a section called **Weekly Links** where I would share 1 great song and 5 interesting links on a weekly basis. Inspired by [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/), and I am pretty committed to this.

## I write in order to do better thinking and creating.

I can't help but write, even if there's little readers or support. It's okay and I'll just keep trying. Also, I devote myself to other kinds of creative works: music, photography, films, etc.

Welcome to wander around my stubstack below (which is in Mandarin). Feel free to subscribe ❤.
